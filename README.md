# 👋 Hi, I'm Shayan

🚀 **Aspiring Software Engineer | Backend & Web Enthusiast**

Hi there! I’m **Shayan**, a student who loves writing backend code that (usually) doesn’t break things.

## 💻 Tech I Speak
- `Python`
- `Java`
- `JavaScript`
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

🔧 Currently leveling up in web frameworks and backend magic.

🍎 Proud Hackintosh user — because why make things simple when they can be *interesting*?  
🐾 Also a proud furry — bringing a bit of fluff to the tech world!

_When I’m not coding, I’m probably debugging why my code **worked yesterday but not today**._

📫 **Feel free to check out my projects and drop a star if they made you smile (or at least didn’t crash).**
